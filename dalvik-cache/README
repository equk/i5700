 equk - relocate dalvik cache to free space on Samsung i5700
*/=========================================================/*

www.equk.co.uk

The script makes the system put dalvik cache into the /cache partition which is 80mb and gets used by various processes for caching & OTA updates (prob don't have those anymore anyway).
The script also removes old system dumps to free space on each reboot of the phone.

The script doesn't make use of slow removable SD Cards (uses fast onboard memory)

Theory/idea:

On looking into the problem it seemed dalvik-cache was taking up 45mb of space on the /data partition of the phone & because of the way the filesystem is partitioned there was a 80mb partition reserved for /cache.

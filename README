This section has a few scripts I have written for tweaking/hacking the Google Android OS

Most of it is aimed specifically at the Samsung i5700

dalvik-cache:
The script makes the system put dalvik cache into the /cache partition which is 80mb and gets used by various processes for caching & OTA updates (prob don't have those anymore anyway).
The script also removes old system dumps to free space on each reboot of the phone.
The script doesn't make use of slow removable SD Cards (uses fast onboard memory)

more to come.....

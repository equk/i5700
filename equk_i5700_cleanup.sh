# Samsung Galaxy Spica i5700 Cleanup Script
#
# Push this to device using adb and run using adb shell, terminal emulator or busybox
# This script is made for a clean ROM install, once run it is worth clearing app caches
#
# Removes: 	Mail App (I use gmail)
#			Google Maps (never used but it annoyingly spawns processes in the background)
#			Miui Music Player (unused so removed to free space)
#			Android Term (possible security risk on rooted devices)
#			DSPManager (problem with audio playback via youtube which breaks audio until reboot)
#
#
# Notes: 	After running the script there should be more space on the device and idle around 80MB RAM free
# 			80MB doesn't seem much but with only 164MB of usable RAM on the device, it is a lot
#
# 				** run this using busybox **
